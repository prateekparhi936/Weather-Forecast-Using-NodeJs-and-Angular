* Created a webpage that allows users to search for weather information using the Forecast.io API and displayed the results on   the same page below the form.

* The user provides the location information such as Street address, City and State for which they
would want to find the detailed weather information or provide their current location.

* Once the user has provided the data and clicks on the Search button, validation must be done to
check that the entered data is valid.

* Once the validation is successful, 3 tabs should be displayed. The 3 tabs correspond to Current tab, Hourly tab and Weekly tab.

* The webpage also supports adding cities to and removing cities from the Favorites tab and sharing the weather info with Twitter

* When a user initially opens your webpage, your page should look like the below figure
